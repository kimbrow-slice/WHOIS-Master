# WHOIS Lookup

The goal of this project is to create an application that will display IP and Domain information within the UI using one or more WHOIS APIs that is comprised of a Frontend built with React and Backend created with Node.

## MVP
Frontend completed with React.

Backend completed with Node.

Display data return by WHOIS API within the UI.

Form for user to submit input.

Deployed using Docker + Heroku.

## Bugs/yet to be completed

Problem: Attach inputValue from the user inside the JSX form to query when onSubmit is triggered from my button. This then will allow the API to display the data.
Solution: fetch the request on the frontend inside the component?

Problem: Make the API repsond to IP addresses not just Domains.
Solution: Unsure? Use another WHOIS API?

Problem: Deploy with docker
Solution: Watch YT video on deploying Heroku/Docker combo once Prod build is completed.


 

## Future Implementions
Add the IP Geolocation feature from WHOIS API.

Calculate amount of searches done since page was first published live.
